# Two pseudo parameters

* `arguments`
* `this`

---

# arguments

* When a function is invoked, in addition to its parameters, it also gets a special parameter called `arguments`
* It contains all of the arguments from the invocation
* It is an array-like object
* `arguments.length` is the number of arguments passed

---

# this

* The `this` parameter contains a reference to the object of invocation
* `this` allows a method to know what object it is concerned with
* `this` allows a single function object to service many functions
* `this` is key to prototypal inheritance
